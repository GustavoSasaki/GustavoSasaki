## About
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I unexpectedly found myself with more free time, so I decided to learn Japanese. To facilitate this, I used [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/) to search for anime suitable to beginners. From his point on I was hooked with web-development. The notion of having a tool accessible to anyone, independent of operating systems or the need for cumbersome installations, felt empowering.

Currently, I am improving my skills in full-stack, from design and front-end to back-end and database management. [GameHongo](https://gamehongo.com/) is my latest project, a website dedicated to helping users discover games and YouTube channels tailored to their Japanese proficiency level, as well as providing a platform to share their experiences with these resources.
